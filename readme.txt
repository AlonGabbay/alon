Guidelines for grading the hackaton:

Our most important task in the Hackaton is to develop a working application to the problem,
and to convince (by graphs, data tables, etc.) that the application answers a specific problem.
Most important is to investigate the problem in detail (background theory and proof).

*even a solution that is not developed by the application will be accepted (very difficult) but its score will be lower according to the table.
