Guidelines for grading the hackaton:

Our most important task in the Hackaton is to develop a working application to the problem,
and to convince (by graphs, data tables, etc.) that the application answers a specific problem.
Most important is to investigate the problem in detail (background theory and proof).

*even a solution that is not developed by the application will be accepted (very difficult) but its score will be lower according to the table.

-Requirements:
1. Detailed Code (DFD, CFD, or use-case + activity diagram)
2. User's Guide
3. Detailed presentation (graphs, data tables, etc.) of the results obtained from the software.
4. Proof of the correctness of the results
5. An in-depth discussion of the background and theory of the problem, detailing all technical details in the application
